   - Button styles
   - Visual elements
3. It generates complete HTML with embedded CSS that matches the design

‚úÖ **Include any text or labels** that should appear

## What You'll Get

```html

        /* All CSS embedded here */
        body { margin: 0; padding: 20px; }
        .container { max-width: 1200px; }
    </style>
</head>
